## ðŸš© Features
- Scalable Real-Time Messaging : Implement a scalable real-time messaging system built on the Internet Computer, benefiting from its high throughput and low latency. This system can handle massive amounts of data and a high number of users without compromising speed or efficiency.
- Blockchain-Enabled Cryptocurrency Transactions : Enable cryptocurrency transactions through the app using a blockchain-based approach, possibly through a regtest environment for safe testing and demonstrations. This will allow users to perform secure and verifiable transactions within their chats.
- Distributed Game Logic : Games integrated into the chat can run their backend logic directly on the Internet Computer, ensuring transparent and verifiable game mechanics. This decentralized approach prevents cheating and enhances performance.
